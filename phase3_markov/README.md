# Phase 3 — Markov Chains & Regime Transitions

## Purpose
Introduce discrete market regimes (Bull, Bear, Sideways) and model their evolution using a Markov chain.  
This bridges stochastic uncertainty from Phase 2 with structured, regime-based dynamics.

## Method
- Define a **transition matrix** for regime probabilities
- Simulate multiple paths to capture different possible market futures
- Highlight **probabilistic evolution of market states**

## Visual Evidence

## Key Insight
- Markets are **not purely random**; they have regime-based structure
- Provides a foundation for Phase 4: linking stochastic + Markov dynamics to real financial time series
- Prepares for **Quantum Fluctuations** in later phases
