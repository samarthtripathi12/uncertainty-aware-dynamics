\# Foundations: Why Uncertainty Is Fundamental



\## 1. The Core Problem

Most financial and AI models attempt to predict \*single outcomes\*.

This implicitly assumes the world is:

\- Linear

\- Stable

\- Gaussian



Real markets are none of these.



They are chaotic, regime-switching systems where uncertainty is not noise,

but structure.



\## 2. Why Classical Models Fail

Deterministic models collapse during:

\- Market crashes

\- Policy shocks

\- Liquidity crises



These failures are not due to lack of data,

but due to the false assumption of certainty.



\## 3. Uncertainty as a First-Class Quantity

In physics, uncertainty is fundamental:

\- Quantum mechanics forbids exact position \& momentum

\- Thermal systems fluctuate even at equilibrium



This project treats financial uncertainty the same way:

as an intrinsic property, not an estimation error.



\## 4. The Physics–Finance Analogy

| Physics | Finance |

|------|--------|

| Position (x) | Price |

| Momentum (p) | Volatility |

| Wave Function ψ | Probability distribution |

| Measurement | Trade execution |



Prediction is treated as \*\*probability evolution\*\*, not point forecasting.



\## 5. Why Markov and Quantum Systems

Markov processes model memoryless regime transitions.

Quantum dynamics model uncertainty propagation.



Together, they form a mathematically grounded framework

for modeling non-deterministic economic systems.



\## 6. Design Philosophy

This project prioritizes:

\- Interpretability over raw accuracy

\- Stability over overfitting

\- Distributional forecasts over point estimates



\## 7. Research Intent

This is not a trading bot.

It is a scientific exploration of uncertainty-aware decision systems.



The long-term goal is safer, more robust AI for high-stakes environments.
